<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The main objective of the project is to develop a fully automated parking solution that benefits both the driver and service providers:
For the customer, the goal is to enhance the parking experience, reduce time spent at the entry gate ensuring a fast and comfortable process.
As for companies, it will decrease management costs, increase the performance of their services and their brand image and lastly decrease air pollution.
    
The driver will be able to pass without stopping in front of the unit to get the entry ticket. The solution will not be using Wi-Fi or cellular data. However, it will be implemented using Bluetooth Low Energy to spot the existence and the location of the driver and decide which barrier gate to open.
The driver has only to download a mobile application to access the parking.
