       This project has been carried out within Scheidt & Bachmann company, which is an international company founded on 1872 in Germany.
   Scheidt & Bachmann Maghreb based in Tunisia is a special team part of the Scheidt & Bachmann division of Parking Solutions.
   It provides and follows the full range of Parking Management Systems for the Middle East, African and Mediterranean Countries.
       
The number of vehicles is increasing significantly and the number of parking spaces in public places and huge buildings for instance: airports, malls, stadiums, etc … are limited. These factors are causing traffic congestion which becomes an alarming and growing problem. Needless to say, the parking problem has been a major factor since one million barrels of oil were burned every day according to © Happiest Minds Technologies. 

Many people in cities around the world, consider the parking experience often as a frustrating activity and causes a lot of traffic jams as well as time-wasting.

All things considered, without having a well-studied plan, these issues will be more complex.
       
The main objective of the project is to develop a fully automated parking solution that benefits both the driver and service providers:
For the customer, the goal is to enhance the parking experience, reduce time spent at the entry gate ensuring a fast and comfortable process.
As for companies, it will decrease management costs, increase the performance of their services and their brand image and lastly decrease air pollution.
    
The driver will be able to pass without stopping in front of the unit to get the entry ticket. The solution will not be using Wi-Fi or cellular data. However, it will be implemented using Bluetooth Low Energy to spot the existence and the location of the driver and decide which barrier gate to open.
The driver has only to download a mobile application to access the parking.
